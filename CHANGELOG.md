# Changelog

All notable changes made while turning the original Windows-only Milk Bar Launcher 2.0.1 codebase into **Hyrule Together** are documented here. This changelog describes the current development state relative to upstream tag `2.0.1` (`22d5184`).

## Unreleased — Hyrule Together cross-platform port

### Project identity

- Renamed the user-facing application from **Milk Bar Launcher** to **Hyrule Together**.
- Updated the Qt application name, window titles, footer, dialogs, server-hosting labels, command-line description, macOS bundle display name, executable name, package names, and primary documentation.
- Changed the macOS bundle identifier to `app.hyruletogether.launcher`.
- Preserved the legacy `MilkBarLauncher` application-data directory and internal BNP/mod filenames intentionally, allowing existing game paths, installed updates, DLC, Cemu configuration, saves, graphic packs, and server settings to continue working after the rename.

### Supported targets and packaging

- Added native build targets for:
  - macOS x86-64;
  - macOS ARM64 with Metal;
  - Linux x86-64; and
  - Linux ARM64.
- Added `scripts/build-bundled-launcher.sh` to produce one target-specific application. The compiled launcher no longer asks users to choose among architectures at runtime.
- Bundled the matching patched Cemu runtime, native multiplayer client, dedicated server, mod archive, UKMM merger, model builder, graphical assets, and Python/Qt runtime.
- Added a direct macOS application-bundle fallback for environments where PyInstaller is unavailable.
- Added target/host validation so incompatible packages cannot accidentally be built on the wrong operating system or CPU architecture.
- Added code signing of development macOS bundles and ZIP packaging through `ditto`.
- Added native component build scripts for the client, server, model builder, UKMM tool, and patched Cemu.
- Added setup and launcher scripts for development use.
- Made `build-bundled-launcher.sh` fully self-bootstrapping: it now creates the local Python virtual environment and installs all packaging requirements before building, eliminating the separate setup command for distributable builds.
- Added Linux Cemu display-backend detection: builds include Wayland when `wayland-protocols >= 1.15` is installed and automatically fall back to X11/XWayland when it is missing, preventing late CMake configuration failures.
- Recorded the compiled Cemu display backend in each bundled runtime. Linux bundles built without Wayland support now force wxGTK onto X11/XWayland at launch, preventing an `Unsupported GTK backend` Vulkan crash on Wayland desktop sessions; Wayland-enabled builds retain native backend selection.

### Native launcher and setup experience

- Replaced the Windows-only WPF injector workflow on macOS/Linux with a Python and Qt launcher.
- Added automatic discovery and validation of the bundled runtime and native client.
- Added guided selection of the decrypted game executable (`code/U-King.rpx`).
- Added update and DLC installation into the launcher's private Cemu MLC directory.
- Corrected update-title validation to accept BOTW's update title ID rather than treating the base-game title ID as the expected update.
- Added persistent launcher configuration, saved servers, selected player model, background choice, and hosting settings.
- Added setup diagnostics and clear validation errors for missing game, update, DLC, runtime, mod, or Cemu hooks.
- Added launch-state reporting and automatic cleanup of stale IPC sockets and Cemu session state.
- Fixed packaged Linux game launches reopening a second Hyrule Together window instead of Cemu. Frozen bundles now re-enter the executable through a dedicated backend-worker mode, while development and portable macOS builds continue to invoke the Python backend directly.
- Prevented Linux Cemu from inheriting PyInstaller's private `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Cemu and its Graphic Pack Manager now load the host's matching X11, GTK, GLib, and Vulkan libraries instead of mixing packaged GUI libraries with the system GPU driver and crashing in `XGetXCBConnection`.
- Added a Settings action that opens Cemu's built-in Graphic Pack Manager for BOTW, allowing FPS++, resolution packs, enhancements, and user-installed cheats to be managed without a separate Cemu setup.
- Restored the application icon using the bundled `icon.png` asset.

### User interface

- Recreated the launcher as a cross-platform Qt interface while retaining the visual direction of the original application.
- Uses one root background image across the entire window; panels and controls are alpha-composited over that single image rather than repeating or faking the background inside individual controls.
- Removed custom close and minimize controls in favor of the operating system's native title-bar controls.
- Added BOTW-inspired buttons, borders, typography, server cards, settings controls, and loading presentation.
- Added hover animation, page transitions, animated loading state, and interactive feedback.
- Added the Lobby Browser, host-server editor, Settings page, model browser, diagnostics, and status views.
- Added true per-pixel translucency without opaque page fills.

### Bundled Cemu integration

- Updated the port for current native Cemu rather than relying on the old Windows injection model.
- Added a reproducible Cemu patching flow.
- Fixed the reproducible Cemu patcher to resolve the Metal shader implementation relative to its supplied header path, allowing clean one-command bundles to apply the sampler patch successfully.
- Added Pillow as an explicit packaging dependency so PyInstaller can convert the launcher PNG icon to the native macOS ICNS format during clean builds.
- Exported `memory_getBase` and the HLE registration entry points required by the native client.
- Added explicit Cemu readiness and hook-readiness synchronization so the client registers callbacks only after coreinit HLE initialization is complete.
- Added support for client-provided HLE-only pseudo modules, enabling the UKMM actor hooks to resolve on native Cemu.
- Added a command-line option that opens Cemu's built-in Graphic Pack Manager filtered to a supplied title ID.
- Added additional crash diagnostics for active PPC state and nearby opcodes.
- Added a Metal sampler mapping fix:
  - maps up to 31 Wii U texture bindings onto Metal's 16 physical sampler slots;
  - declares each physical sampler only once;
  - maps every generated shader reference to the same deduplicated slot; and
  - avoids both out-of-range sampler bindings and duplicate sampler declarations.
- Added one-time invalidation of stale BOTW Metal shader and pipeline caches after the sampler-layout change.

### Cross-platform native client

- Added a CMake build for the injected/native multiplayer client, producing `.dylib` on macOS and `.so` on Linux.
- Added a compatibility platform layer for Win32 types, timing, threads, virtual-memory queries, dynamic symbol lookup, filesystem paths, sockets, and endian-sensitive memory access.
- Replaced Windows named pipes with a local Unix-domain socket IPC channel on macOS/Linux.
- Added portable application-data path handling.
- Reworked logging so the client, launcher, and server use predictable platform-specific locations.
- Corrected several non-portable exception constructions, path operations, string conversions, socket assumptions, and structure definitions.
- Added safe initialization waits for Cemu's emulated-memory base and HLE subsystem.
- Hardened client startup and disconnect behavior when configuration or runtime hooks are missing.
- Added a separate generated Linux client source area. Linux builds copy the shared implementation to `Build/linux-client-source`, normalize inherited `static class`/`extern struct` MSVC extensions for GCC, and add the required `<cmath>` include, while macOS continues compiling the original tested source tree unchanged.
- Extended the generated Linux compatibility pass for GCC's stricter math namespace rules (`std::tan`), and removed legacy `.cpp` `#pragma once` and integer `NULL` warnings from Linux build output.

### Native Cemu memory scanning

- Reworked legacy `VirtualQuery`-based scans that assumed Cemu's Wii U heap was the eighth Windows memory region.
- On native Cemu, region-8 scans now operate only inside Cemu's 4 GiB emulated-memory reservation.
- Native scans start at the true emulated-memory base rather than trusting Windows allocation-order offsets that may point beyond the desired value.
- Prevented failed scans from traversing unrelated host-process address space indefinitely.
- Corrected location and equipped-item scans for native Cemu's memory layout.
- Added detailed scan-stage logging for location, equipment, world day, attack modifier, core player state, and multiplayer flags.
- Confirmed the client now reaches `Scanned game instance successfully.` on macOS ARM64 Cemu.
- Added address validation before runtime notification writes.

### Multiplayer startup and resilience

- Added the in-game quest-log notification `Server sync started!` after Link is discovered and the synchronization scan begins.
- Added explicit logging when the notification is written successfully.
- Fixed the previous timing behavior where the notification could be queued before safe game memory was available.
- Added actor-hook diagnostics and verified Link discovery through native Cemu HLE callbacks.
- Prevented an uncaught missing-flag exception from aborting Cemu with `signal 6`.
- Made absent legacy animation, held/equipped-state, attack-animation, and map-pin flags optional when UKMM does not expose them in the current runtime data.
- Added guarded writes for every optional address.
- Core position, state, player-name, connection, server, and actor synchronization can proceed when optional cosmetic flags are unavailable.
- Added the success log `Scanned core game flags successfully.` for this compatibility mode.
- Activated the existing remote equipment application path: received weapon, shield, bow, head, upper-body, and lower-body IDs are now applied when a remote actor spawns and whenever its equipment packet changes.
- Restored native animation synchronization by resolving each remote actor's animation-state pointer directly and applying changed animation hashes without relying on unavailable legacy UKMM string flags.
- Added a sub-40 ms low-latency movement mode with TCP packet coalescing disabled on clients and servers plus 120 Hz remote extrapolation; higher-latency sessions retain the stable 60 Hz path.

### Player model and game-data preparation

- Bundled a target-native model-builder utility.
- Added automatic creation and validation of the remote-player BFRES model assets.
- Added automatic UKMM merge against the user's own decrypted base game, update, and DLC files.
- Added validation that required model and animation files were produced before launch.
- Added automatic installation and enablement of the generated Cemu graphic pack.
- Added a belt-lookup guard patch to avoid invalid equipment/model lookup crashes.
- Preserved support for selectable player/NPC models and associated model metadata.

### Dedicated server

- Ported the dedicated server projects to modern cross-platform .NET targets.
- Added self-contained publication for macOS and Linux runtime identifiers so users do not need to install .NET.
- Added a non-interactive dedicated-server mode suitable for launcher-managed hosting.
- Added explicit server configuration-file support.
- Added platform-specific shared-data and log paths.
- Added graceful shutdown handling and launcher-managed process cleanup.
- Improved TCP framing so fragmented or combined packets are handled safely.
- Added IPv4, IPv6, hostname, and loopback handling.
- Hardened connection removal, shared-state access, serialization, and malformed-client handling.
- Updated tests and project references for the modern server target.

### Hosting and connectivity

- Added a GUI flow to create, save, and start a local dedicated server.
- Automatically adds a newly hosted loopback server to the server list.
- Streams server startup and failure status back into the launcher.
- Keeps the server alive for the Cemu session and shuts it down with the launcher.
- GUI-hosted servers now open in a real interactive macOS/Linux terminal, showing live join/leave logs and accepting every dedicated-server console command; a PID-file handshake preserves launcher readiness checks and managed shutdown.
- Supports connecting native clients across the target platforms through the shared network protocol.

### Diagnostics and stability work

- Started native-client logging at preload time instead of after HLE hook installation, ensuring bootstrap failures always produce `LatestLog.txt`.
- Added explicit bootstrap diagnostics for Cemu memory-export resolution, emulated-memory initialization, HLE readiness, hook installation, hook acknowledgement, and launcher IPC connection.
- Added Linux packaging validation for all four required Cemu dynamic exports and made launcher IPC timeouts report the last native-client bootstrap status.
- Added detailed `LatestLog.txt` output for server connection, player assignment, actor hooks, memory-scan stages, notification delivery, and compatibility fallbacks.
- Diagnosed and fixed the infinite native scan that consumed several CPU cores without reaching scan completion.
- Diagnosed the post-scan `signal 6` as an intentional uncaught exception caused by unavailable legacy flags, then removed that fatal path.
- Added guards around message, animation, equipment-state, attack, and map-pin memory writes.
- Added Cemu stack-trace detail to distinguish host-side failures from active PPC game faults.
- Fixed several invalid pointer and native address assumptions that previously caused inventory-related or delayed crashes.

### Documentation and build hygiene

- Added cross-platform build, development, packaging, configuration, hosting, and runtime documentation.
- Documented target-specific build requirements and output locations.
- Documented the private application-data layout and why its legacy name is retained.
- Expanded `.gitignore` for generated cross-platform artifacts, local tools, caches, and build products.
- Removed obsolete legacy Windows updater sources that contained embedded GitHub credentials; the cross-platform launcher does not use authenticated updater requests.

### Current compatibility notes

- Core multiplayer initialization and scanning are operational in the tested macOS ARM64 Metal build.
- A second physical client is still required for complete end-to-end validation of cross-device spawning and movement.
- Current UKMM-generated data does not expose the legacy optional animation/equipment/map-pin flags expected by the original Windows client. Core synchronization continues, but those cosmetic fields are disabled until equivalent addresses or data definitions are implemented.
- Native Cemu and the launcher do not contain copyrighted game files. Users must supply their own legally obtained and decrypted base game, update, and DLC data.
